`goo` is a simple version manager for Go

## Where does goo install versions of Go?
`goo` install Go versions in `$HOME/.goo/`

# Features
* manages `$GOPATH`
* manages `$GOROOT`
* allows multiple versions of Go to be installed without conflict
* auto expand Github repositories
* cross platform

# Installation
Download the latest `goo` binary [here](/releases/latest) and place it in `$HOME/.goo/bin`

Add the installation path to your `$PATH`:
```Bash
$ export PATH=$PATH:$HOME/.goo/bin
```

Note: If you already have a local Go installation, you can optionally install via `go get`:
```Bash
$ go get github.com/gernest/goo
```

## Usage

Installing latest Go version:
```Bash
$ goo install latest
```
	
Install specific Go version:
```Bash
$ goo install 1.5
```
	
Get the list of available Go versions for download:
```Bash

```

Determine which version of Go is active:
```Bash
$ goo which go
```

```

The Go tool and all of its power is exposed via:
```Bash
$ goo go
```

For example, building a project:
```Bash
$ goo go build
```
