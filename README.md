# WIN AT GOLANG WITH GO.

goo is a commandline tool that makes it easier to develop with golang.
It simplifies installation, configuration and use of golang tool chains.

The goo tool  wraps the golang go command, enabling you to have
full power of golang with minimal efforts.

Goo manages GOROOT, and GOPATH for you. And you don't have to worry about permissions
Infact goo recomends  not to be run with root permissions, only that your home directory
is writable.

Goo supports multiple versions of golang. Meaning you can test your code against multiple versions
of golang locally easily and secure with goo.

## Where is the go toolchain installed?

Goo install go versions tn your home directory i.e $HOME/.goo. So you can just delete the
directory if you dont want to mess with golang anymore.
